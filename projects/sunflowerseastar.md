# Sunflower Sea Stars and Sea Star Wasting Disease
I've been working on the epidemiology team for Sea Star Wasting Disease (SSWD) since Summer 2021. 

I've been involved in running and helping design disease challenge experiments, taking samples, processing samples, and my main focus is studying the immune response of the sea stars using transcriptomics. 

# Exciting anouncements:

At long last, the big announcement has been revealed - our epidemiology team, with invaluable support and help from tons of folks from many organizations and institutions, have discovered the pathogen that causes sea star wasting disease in Sunflower Sea Stars.

The organizations that have contributed personnel, expertise, resources, and more to this project are: Hakai Institute, the University of British Columbia, the University of Washington, the US Geological Survey, and the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife. It was funded by The Nature Conservancy and the Tula Foundation, with research conducted at the Marrowstone Marine Field Station in Washington State, run by the US Geological Survey’s Western Fisheries Research Center.
