- Update this summer's sample log
- Work on updating notebook from the summer work
- Submit WSN abstract (due Friday)

# Oct 9 - 13
## Sea Star Work
- See about getting help with data entry
- Order extraction kits for this fall's RNA extractions
- revisit summer 2021 RNAseq work (will be what I present at WSN)

# Oct 16 - 20
