# Self-assessment
I've figured out some ways to work and organize this past month that has really changed a lot of things for me! I've been sitting down each morning to plan out task chunks, writing notebook posts more frequently, and also have tried body-doubling with a friend over zoom.

I could improve on asking for help SOONER. I've gone down some rabbit holes in recent weeks and if I had asked for input or help sooner I could have saved some time. I also could figure out how to better prioritize my varying responsibilities and tasks - I feel behind on my paper writing, and if I had allocated my time a bit better, I'd be further along. 

Moving forward I want to:
- continue notebook posts
- continue planning my days into achievable task chunks
- ask for input/help sooner
- identify priority tasks and focus on those first
