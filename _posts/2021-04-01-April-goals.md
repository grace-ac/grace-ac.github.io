## Crab Paper
I'm assuming we'll be getting reviewer comments soon...? So if those get in, then I'll likely be working on addressing those with the other authors. 

## Misc.
For Jackie Padilla-Gamino lab:        
- I've started extracting RNA from _O. lurida_ larvae and am almost done      
- Then I'll move on to the 40 tissue samples from adult _O. lurida_     
- I've spoken with the sequenicng facility we'll be sending the samples to and they want the samples (n = 56) in a 96-well plate, at least 25ul  of volume per sample, and the Qubit and Nanodrop readouts for each. They also recommended spot-checking some on the BIoanalzyer, though they'll be doing that as well before library prep and sequencing. 

Crab samples in -80:     
- I've begun organizing and condensing the boxes of hemolymph samples - I'm making spreadsheets of the contents of the boxes. I'm almost done with the samples, but haven't started sorting through and organizing the extracted RNA that's in there

# Look back on my [March Goals](https://grace-ac.github.io/MarchGoals/)    
Main thing is that I got a lot of things started, and this month I'm hoping to finish them!
