Received RNAseq data from Genewiz/Azenta for the Multi-Species experiment. Started data transfer 1:25pm.

# Transferring Data
Using the guide [here](https://web.azenta.com/hubfs/2019-03%20GEN%20NGS%20-%20ATAC-Seq%20FAQs/13012-M&G%200523%20sFTP%20Data%20Download%20Guide.pdf), I used the option with [CyberDuck](https://cyberduck.io/download/) because that's what I used for the 2021 and 2022 dataset, and it's still a recommended method of file transfer.

The data is being transferred onto the conference room computer in the Documents folder for _Pycnopodia helianthoides_ RNAseq. The other two projects' raw files are in that folder as well.

Once downloaded, I'll check that it was done correctly, and then upload them onto OWL: [https://owl.fish.washington.edu/nightingales/P_helianthoides/](https://owl.fish.washington.edu/nightingales/P_helianthoides/), where they'll sit with the other _P. helianthoides_ RNAseq datasets, waiting to be analyzed!
