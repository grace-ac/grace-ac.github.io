Update on DIA anaylsis of the 2015 Oysterseed project, working on determining the error rate of Skyline's peak picking. 


I continued with the Skyline DIA analysis of the [2015 Oyster Seed Project](https://github.com/RobertsLab/project-pacific.oyster-larvae/wiki/2015-Oyster-Seed-experiment-23C-vs.-29C) data.

I followed the protocol for DIA Analyses and am currently at [Step 5b](https://github.com/RobertsLab/resources/blob/master/protocols/DIA-data-Analyses.md#step-5b-spot-check-peptides). 

Yaamini showed me how to generate a per-peptide and per-sample error rate spreadsheet. Link to my spreadsheet thus far: [here](http://owl.fish.washington.edu/scaphapoda/grace/2018-01-10_errorchecking.xlsx). And the link to my current Skyline document is [here](http://owl.fish.washington.edu/scaphapoda/grace/2015Cg.sky).

I am going to continue until I spot-check 100 peptides and will then continue on to DIA-Analysis Step 5c.
