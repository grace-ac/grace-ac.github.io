Starting in on RNA extractions of samples from Day 12 (controls) and Day 6 (exposed and controls) from the multi-species experiment. See post for details.

# RNA Extraction
Notes:   
- the Kits i have are from 2024 -- this is 1 year, which from what I can find online - they are still usable          
- DNAse I --> from 2024 and was reconstituted then and stored at -20C since then (Cat: E1009-A; Lot: 223372)        
- Samples 434 and 534 have brownish tissue at the bottom (the pellet + 300ul DNA/RNA Shield - prior to starting the extraction protocol)     
- Proteinase K aliquot from -20C freezer had pelleted after thawing, so I vortexed                 

Start at 10:15am (take samples from freezer and thaw on wet ice)    
Start extraction protocol at: 10:40am     
Start incubation at 10:45am, continue with extraction at 11:25am     

Finished whole protocol at 12:59pm     
Put extracted RNA in -80C immediately.     
DNA (on yellow filters) is in -20C (needs to finish extraction process if want DNA).                  


# To Do Soon:
Run these 12 samples on Qubit.    
Continue on through extractions.
