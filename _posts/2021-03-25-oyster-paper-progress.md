Added a little to the oyster discussion, then went down a slight tangent looking for and then looking into the histology report results from the samples taken for this project. 

### Oyster paper: [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OaYNzlOJr5QibCYt8--GMNGvXlzHPR9_daCkNUVkj-U/edit#)      
### Oyster ppaer GitHub repo: [here](https://github.com/grace-ac/paper-pacific.oyster-larvae)

I added a little to the discussion about infuences on oyster susceptibility to ciliates and other pathogens (salinity, seasonality, temperature), so that's good. 

I then started thinking more about the salinity and realized I didn't have anything in the oyster rearing methods about what salinity they were kept at. So I dug around the [RobertsLab/project-pacific.oyster-larvae](https://github.com/RobertsLab/project-pacific.oyster-larvae) to see if I could find anything. I couldn't. 

I came across the [reports](https://github.com/RobertsLab/project-pacific.oyster-larvae/tree/master/reports) directory which I have been in before and remembered not having access to the Histology reports from this project. Samples were taken on Days 5 and 8 of the experiemnt for proteomics AND for histology. I made a GitHub issue asking about the reports [here](https://github.com/RobertsLab/resources/issues/1164), but it's not a big deal. 

I looked through an old [.pdf version of Rhonda's 2015 paper](https://github.com/RobertsLab/project-pacific.oyster-larvae/blob/master/paper-2015/2015%20Oyster%20seed%20Experiment-%20Taylor%20Hatchery.pdf), and found that she'd written out about the histology report results. The histology report apparently includes information on digestive gland quality, and presence or absence of bactieral infections and protozoan ciliates. Essentially the results are:    
23 C        
ciliates: none on day 5; 44% infected on day 8     
digestive gland quality: above average quality on day 5 (32% high quality; 36% medium; 32% low; 0% very low), and slight improvement by day 8 (48% high quality; 32% medium; 16%low; 4% very low)
bacteria: none on day 5; none on day 8    

29 C     
ciliates: none on day 5; none on day 8     
digestive gland quality: overall poor quality on day 5 (4% high quality; 8% medium quality; 28% low quality; 60% very low quality); huge improvement by day 8 (44% high quality; 36% medium quality; 20% low quality; 0% very low quality)   
bacteria: none on day 5 and none on day 8 


If these results are what's in the actual reports, it's kind of interesting, especially the digestive gland quality included with the ciliate presence/absence. The oysters in 23C started out really well with great digestive gland quality, but by day 8, there was high infection with ciliates and the quality of digestive glands didn't improve and in some got way worse. The oysters in 29C started out poorly, maybe the temperature was too high for them...?, but then over the course of a couple days, their digestive gland quality did a HUGE flip from poor (60% had very low quality! only 4% had high quality!) to overall high quality (44% had high quality!) and there were no ciliates. 

I think it would be cool to add this information in to the paper and expand on it a bit more if we can find the reports from Dr. Ralph Eston at Aquatechnics.
