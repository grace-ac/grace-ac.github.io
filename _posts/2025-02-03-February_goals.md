# First Paper!
I have a final draft ready! I am doing some final fine-tune edits, and will be submitting it the journal special issue this week!

# Multi-species work
The repository will be kept private, but I'll share some general goals and updates in my notebook!

## This week:
- compile all files needed for analyses into GitHub repository
- trim RNAseq data for all three species
- index genomes
- get count matrices for all three species

## Rest of month
- figure out how to compare the three species (can't do DESeq2 for each species because didn't get RNAseq from controls...) - will discuss this week in lab meeting to get some ideas
- carry-out analyses

# Eelgrass work this spring and summer
- Figure out with Eric from FHL what permitting is required to work with bacteria in the FHL OA lab - more details on this project in the coming months
- Plan out experimental treatments

# Other
Write up some summary posts from what I've done the past 1.5-ish months!!

And keep up on notebook posts this month!
