See post for details on what I want to touch base on with Steven tomorrow!

# Updates:   
- Multispecies RNA extractions are going great!! --> I'll be finishing the rest tomorrow and then sending out to seq facility on Wednesday morning
- I think I now have all the files I need for aligning the current multispecies dataset to their respective genomes - namely the _D. imbricata_ and _P. ochraceus_ files   

# What I'd like guidance on:

What's the best way to go about describing and comparing the different gene expression profiles for the current dataset so I can share at Wildlife Disease Association Conference (July 27-Aug 1).   

I'm thinking:    
1. Align RNAseq data to respective genomes
2. Annotate with whatever annotation files I have from the collaborators   
3. BLAST?
4. Gene ontology annotation

What else?   

I'm also trying to think of interesting visuals - but I think that will come up in next week's meeting with Steven because the first step is finalizing the alignments for _D. imbricata_ and _P. ochraceus_
