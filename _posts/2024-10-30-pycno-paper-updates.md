Updates on results and methods for the paper.

# Results
Trying to get a list of differentially expressed genes that are shared across the two summers that contribute to the top 9 significantly enriched biological processes (Benjamini-Hochberg <0.05).

GitHub  Issue: [1996](https://github.com/RobertsLab/resources/issues/1996)

Used the solution from [chatqpt](https://chatgpt.com/share/671c1bb2-c178-8013-aa40-fe7f974859ac) for R that Steven found.
