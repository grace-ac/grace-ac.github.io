I have not done well with keeping this notebook updated on a regular basis... so I am going to start writing myself physical notes to help remember!
In the meantime, here's a somewhat mid-month update on how I've been doing on my October goals:

## Ongoing things:
- sea star image organization: _getting a day or two's worth of photos filed from the summer every day this week and most days the previous weeks_
- Eelgrass NSF GeoHealth Supplement grant: _have been meeting with Drew, working on drafts, contacting folks in various organizations, and setting up meetings to find a location for the internship and to have something ready for the proposal_

## Oct 2-6 Sea Star Work:
- Create detailed and organized repositories for all the data I have! Separate repositories for each summer (2021, 2022, and 2023) <-- _NEARLY DONE! I have repositories made, but am working on adding deatils to the readme's for information on all the projects._
- Update this summer's sample log <-- _DONE!! that took some time... we took a lot of samples this summer_
- Work on updating notebook from the summer work <-- _NOT DONE!!! Need to do._
- Submit WSN abstract (due Friday) <-- _DONE_

# Oct 9 - 13
## Sea Star Work
- See about getting help with data entry <-- _DONE! Noah in the Roberts lab will be helping with it._
- Order extraction kits for this fall's RNA extractions <-- _NOT DONE! Need to do._
- revisit summer 2021 RNAseq work (will be what I present at WSN) <-- _Done! And ongoing. Will be re-working the update I gave the Pycno working group earlier this year to make it more for a general audience/marine disease focused audience._

# Oct 16 - 20
## Sea Star Work
- Continue transcriptomic work <-- _not there yet ---> working on revisiting what I have already done and working it into WSN talk._
- Plan out extractions for fall <-- _not there yet --> working on thinking about the samples I have and how many I'd reasonably like to work towards extracting (I have ~700+ samples... which is way probably way too many)_
