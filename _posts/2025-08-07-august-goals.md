See post for details. 

# Updates: 
- WDA went great (working on a notebook post on it)       
- Got revisions back for the immune response paper (goals to tackle it below) 

# Goals: 

## Crab Paper
Aspen has a paper on BioRxiv and she did a beautiful job! We want it to be submitted to a peer review journal, and so I'll take on that task since she's graduated and moved on. (Paper on BioRxiV: [Uncovering Host-Parasite Dynamics: Gene Expression Shifts in Hematodinium-infected Chionoecetes bairdi in Response to Temperature Change](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.06.05.658092v2.abstract))

## Notebook posts     
- Notebook post about our sea star team's announcement       
- Notebook post about what I did for the multispecies work for WDA 

## Paper Revisions
Most revisions will be easy. One reviewer suggested re-doing/re-assessing the age class comparison, and they provided this really cool and detailed blog post that I'll look at and see what comes of it. (Blog post: [A guide to designs and contrasts in DESeq2](https://www.atakanekiz.com/technical/a-guide-to-designs-and-contrasts-in-DESeq2/)) 

So I'll:       
- Re-do the `DESeq2` based on the guide linked above      
- address remaining comments after    

## Multi-species work
I have more data coming in September!! So in the mean time, here's what I can do:        
- Look for orthologs â†’ there are programs specific for that 
- Compare genomes independent of the data
- Set up notebooks so that when data comes in, I can plug things in and run them
