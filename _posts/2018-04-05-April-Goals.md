- RNA Isolation
  - Isolate RNA from all crabs within the subset I selected (2 more sets of 9 to go)
  - Run Qubit on ALL of the isolated RNA samples from the subset I selected
  
- Podcast
  - Edit the three recordings I have that are about:
    - RNA isolation
    - Crab mtg #2
    - Background info on the project (Ep. 1)
  - Come out with an episode each week
    
- Data
  - Organize into master spreadsheet - or at least start the process (morph data; qubit; EVERYTHING)
  - Add Qubit results to the spreadsheet containing the subset of samples that I'm working with to isolate RNA
