Initial info on making a Podcast from Audacity workshop at UW and Crab Hemolymph samples next steps - testing out the RNA isolation protocol.


## Podcast

I stopped by the [UW Student Technology Loan Program](https://stlp.uw.edu/#/equipment) in the basement of Kane Hall. I asked for recommendations on equipment for creating and publishing a podcast. I was recommended three different kind of audio recorders and have rented all three so that we can do trial runs to determine what we'd like to purchase. The three are 
- [Sony UWP - V1](https://www.cte.uw.edu/w/images/6/69/Sony_WMS_Manual.pdf)
- [Olympus WS-510M](http://www.olympusamerica.com/files/oima_cckb/ws-520M_ws-510M_ws-500M_ws-400S_Detailed_Instructions_en.pdf)
- [Samson Meteor Mic](http://www.samsontech.com/site_media/legacy_docs/Meteor%20Mic_OM_v1.pdf)

To publish a podcast, you have to have your podcast in mp3 format and use a software. There are many options, but here are three:
- [iTunes](https://create.blubrry.com/manual/podcast-promotion/submit-podcast-to-itunes/)
- [WordPress](http://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-tutorials/step-by-step-guide-how-to-start-a-podcast-with-wordpress/)
- [SoundCloud](https://on.soundcloud.com/creator-guide/podcasting)

The podcast is part of the outreach portion of the NPRB Crab project proposal.

## Crab Hemolymph Samples

Next steps for the crab project are to test out the [RNA isolation protocol](https://github.com/RobertsLab/resources/blob/master/protocols/rna_isolation_rnazol_rt.md) on some of the extra samples so that I have an understanding of the process before doing it with the samples I have chosen.
