Result from Qubit of RNA isolation samples and new episode of DecaPod published! Episode on RNA isolation - S1E4.

### Qubit
I did Qubit on 14 more samples today. I ran out of the RNA HS Reagent, so Pam will have to order more.

### DecaPod

I edited and published [S1E4-RNA-isolation](https://bittercrab.wordpress.com/2018/04/06/decapod-s1e4-rna-isolation/) 

I am still adding a little bit more info to the first episode, which will contain background info on the project. The episode will be about 15 mins.
