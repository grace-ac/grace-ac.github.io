This post contains a slightly modified RNeasy Kit protocol. I want to use the Qiagen RNeasy Micro Plus Kit on 4 crab hemolymph pellet samples and the four corresponding supernatant samples ([GitHub Issue 577](https://github.com/RobertsLab/resources/issues/577)). The goal is to see if there is any RNA in the supernatant samples and if that can help increase the RNA yields for each crab sample. The supernatant samples (~1ml each) will be transfered to 15ml falcon tubes and the volumes of reagents likely need to be changed ([GitHub Issue ](https://github.com/RobertsLab/resources/issues/578)). I will be using RNA carrier for both supernatant and pellet samples. (Sidenote: just realized I didn't use QIAshredder columns when I did the RNeasy protocol previously. I have added that to my [figure](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1BduMHnANqwlB6ovVXZ-wbUyFahb95W5spx1yKjXn65s/edit).)

# Prepare solutions:

### Buffer RLT plus + B-ME (needs to be ratio of 10ul B-ME per 1ml Buffer RLT Plus):       
40 ul of B-ME        
4  ml of Buffer RLT Plus      

### RNA Carrier solution: 
**Before first-time use-**       
add 1ml of RNase-free H20 to dissolve the carrier RNA.       
Store this stock solution in -15 to -30C.       
Use stock to make fresh dilutions for each set of RNA preps    

**Make working solution**      
Add 5ul of stock solution to 34 ul of Buffer RLT plus        
mix by pipetting

Add 6 ul of this diluted solution to 54ul of Buffer RLT plus to get a working solution of 4ng/ul


# Protocol: 

Move the ~1ml of supernatant to a 15ml falcon tube

1. Add 350ul of Buffer RLT Plus and B-ME solution. Vortex to mix and run through a QIA shredder column 700ul at a time to further homogenize. 

2. Add 5ul of diluted carrier RNA (20 ng carrier RNA) solution and vortex 1 min.        

3. Transfer the homogenized lysate to a gDNA Eliminator spin column placed in a 2ml collection tube. Centrifuge for 30s and full speed. Discard column and save flow-through. 

4. Add 350ul of 70% ethanol to flow-through from step 3. Mix well by pipetting. Do not centrifuge. 

5. Transfer sample, including any precipitate that may have formed, to an RNeasy MinElute  spin column placed in a 2ml collection tube. Close the lid gently and centrifuge for 15s at full speed. Discard flow-through. 

6. Add 700ul of Buffer RW1 to RNeasy MinElute spin column. close lid gently and centrifuge for 15s at full speed. Discard flow-through. 

7. Add 500ul of Buffer RPE to RNeasy MinElute spin column. close lid gently and centrifuge for 15s at full speed. Discard flow-through. 

8. Add 500ul of 80% ethanol to RNeasy MinElute spin column. Close lid gently and centrifuge for 2 min at full speed. Discard collection tube and flow-through. 

9. Place RNeasy MinElute spin column in new 2ml collection tube. Cut off and save lid of spin column. Place tubes open in the centrifuge and spin at full speed for 5 min. Discard collection tube and flow-through 

10. Place RNeasy MinElute spin column in new 1.5 ml collection tube. Add 14ul RNase-free water directly to center of spin column membrane. Close lid gently and centrifuge for 1 min at full speed to elute RNA.
