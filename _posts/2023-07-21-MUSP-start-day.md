Today, we started the multi-species experiment! Very exciting! Details in post below.

### Pre-Treatment Sampling!
We took observation data down for each star prior to sampling. Observation data follows what we've done for these experiments the previous 2 summers and this summer. Each star has it's own data sheet. We record the date, time, whether or not it's getting fed, location (location in the bin: Far side (FS), near side (NS), Right (R), Left (L), Bottom (B), Surface (S), where the far side R is the drain end), whether or not it's moved since the previous data point (yes/no), disease score (0-4, based on disease signs at time of observation), number of arms twisted, number of arms crossed, number of lesions, stretching (yes/no: we've noticed that some will be stretching their arms out prior to arm loss), uneven turgor (yes/no: we've also noticed that their turgor pressure will be off prior to waste), bleaching (yes/no: this is specific to Derms as we don't know exactly what a wasting one will look like, but there has been some sightings of bleaching tissue... possibly wasting), number of arms dropped, and whether or not we're sampling the star.

We sampled all of the stars for coelomic fluid (CF) and preserved the coelomocytes (spun CF 12,000rpm for 5min) with 300ul DNA/RNA Shield and put in the -80C, and saved the supernatant in a microfuge tube and placed in -80C.

We sampled them all between 10am and 11:30am. Alyssa and I did the sampling, Melanie would come and get batches of the CF to process for preserving coelomocytes and supernatant, and Andrew helped keeping track of the tube numbers in the sample log and with holding the bins as they filled back up with water.

To sample, we dumped the bin's water out down the drain. Sampled the CF using needles and syringes (33CC insulin syringes for the _Dermasterias imbricata_ and the _Pycnopodia helianthoides_, and 1ml syringes with 26G _____ needles for the _Pisaster ochraceus_ and some of the larger _Dermasterias_). Images below of what that looked like.

For the Derms, we figured out that putting the needle into the beige-colored part of the armpits toward the central disc cavity yielded most frequently a lot of CF, but sometimes would put in at the top of the arms going in toward the central disc if the armpit didn't work. The below example wasn't typical, but this particular Derm was upside down.

For the Pisaster, we put the needles in nearly horizontal at the top of the arms, in toward the central disc.

For the Pycno, we do what we always do, which is put the needle in at the armpit, angled toward the central disc cavity.

The CF was placed in a labeled microfuge tube (PSC ###), where each tube number is unique, and we put in our sample log what animal it is associated with, and what time the CF was collected. Melanie spun the CF down, removed the supernatant, added 300ul of shield to the cells, and saved the supernatant. She marked down the time that the samples were placed in the -80C.

A side note: Alyssa and I sampled the bins at the back (Table 2, bins 1-8) together as she finished the ones in the front (Table 4, bins 9-16) before I finished. We were each sampling a bin, I was doing bin 7 and she was doing bin 6. The lids ended up getting mixed up when we finished such that the stars in bin 6 got put in bin's 7 spot and the bin 7 lid, along with the water hose and the airstone, were placed in with bin 6 stars. We realized it quickly and I cleaned the lids, and replaced the water hoses and airstones for both bin 6 and 7.

Bin 7 was exceptionally foamy post-sampling... likely the pycno. Several pycnos were foamy after sampling, but not all. Likely the saponins that get released as a stress response...?

We fed the stars after sampling. Because they're co-housed and there's no good way to ensure each gets 1 mussel like they usually do in their individual bins, we decided to overfeed them. We put 6 mussels (enough for 2 each) into each bin with the hopes that they'll each get at least one. There's no way for us to know for sure, but that seemed like the best option.

### Inoculation!
Here's what the adult (disease source, adult E), looks like today:
