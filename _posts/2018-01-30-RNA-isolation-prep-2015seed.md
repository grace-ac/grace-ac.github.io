I prep for RNA isolation and understanding the protocol, and continue with the 2015 Oysterseed DIA.


## RNA Isolation prep

I will test out the [RNA isolation protocol](https://github.com/RobertsLab/resources/blob/master/protocols/rna_isolation_rnazol_rt.md) on some of the extra crab hemolymph samples we have stored in the -80. Since we are using hemolymph and not tissue, we will not need to use a mortar and pestle. Instead, I found this information regarding liquid samples:


"C. Liquid Samples. Homogenize/lyse liquid samples using 1 ml of RNAzol® RT per 0.4 ml of a liquid sample. For processing a small volume sample, mix the sample with 1 ml of RNAzol® RT and supplement the mixture with water to approach the sample + water volume of 0.4 ml."

This information was found [here](https://www.mrcgene.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/RNAzolRTMarch2017.pdf) by looking at the mrcgene.com full protocol for RNAzol RT.

## 2015 Oysterseed DIA Analysis

I exported the Skyline data into a .csv report ([Cg2015seed.csv](http://owl.fish.washington.edu/scaphapoda/grace/2015-oysterseed-project/Cg2015seed.csv)). I will now do my best to follow [Laura's notebook protocol for DIA Analysis](https://github.com/RobertsLab/Paper-DNR-Geoduck-Proteomics/blob/master/notebooks/SRM/04-SRM%20Data%20Analysis.ipynb).
