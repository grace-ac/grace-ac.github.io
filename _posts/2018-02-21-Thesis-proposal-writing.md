This quarter I am taking FISH 521, which is the Research Proposal Writing and Professional Development course taught by Julian Olden. This class has been very helpful because it has guided me through the layout of the Crab Project and the plan of how it will all be performed. This is good becuase this is my first quarter of graduate school and I had only heard about the crab project around Thanksgiving of 2017. 

Today I worked more on my final draft of my thesis proposal, which is due this weekend.

### DIA Analysis

Tomorrow morning I will devote some hours to getting more done on the DIA analysis of the 2015 oysterseed data.
