Updates on Summer 2022 data entry and Summer 2021/2022 analyses - see post for details.

# Summer 2022 Data Entry
I entered one star's worth of data. I have three more stars to do - will be finishing them THIS WEEK!

# Summer 2021 and 2022 Analyses
R code for alignements: [paper-pycno-sswd-2021-2022/code/20-hisat2-genecount-matrices.Rmd](https://github.com/grace-ac/paper-pycno-sswd-2021-2022/blob/main/code/20-hisat2-genecount-matrices.Rmd)

The alignments for 2021 have completed... and I was going to move on to the next step of converted the .sam files to .bam files... but I decided to first pull from Github while working in Raven.... and got an error.

I don't really understand what it means. here's the GitHub Issue where Steven and Sam have been helping me: [Issue 1968](https://github.com/RobertsLab/resources/issues/1968_)

I won't be continuing the analyses until I figure this out because I don't want to lose anything or mess anything up. Also, I can't commit and push any changes anyway until the issue is resolved.

### UPDATE: Issue resolved. The HDD is full... so I deleted a BUNCH OF HUGE UNNECESSARY FILES! And now there's space.

So now I'm coverting the .sam files to .bam files.

# Meetings
I had two meetings this afternoon with different factions of the sea star team to go over progress and goals.
