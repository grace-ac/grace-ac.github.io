Today I speed vac-ed the new pool of 15 samples for a little over three hours. There is still more than 50ul in the tube, so I'll put it back in the speed vac as soon as I am in tomorrow morning. 

The pooled sample is 150ul (15 samples, each 10ul).      
Sam and I went over to the Speed Vac in FSH. At 10:50am, it was started on medium heat. 

At 2:10pm, there was still too much liquid. As soon as I am in tomorrow am, I'll put it back in the speed vac.

Put the sample in (cap open) a slot that has a little bit of paper towel stuffed in the bottom. Close lid. Turn on the machine. Turn the heat to medium. After it runs for a bit, turn on the vacuum (turn yellow valve marked "Vac" toward the machine). Then open up the vacuum by turning the blue dial on top of the machine to "open" (to the right). 

To open it later, close the vacuum (blue dial) and then wait til it stops spinning.
