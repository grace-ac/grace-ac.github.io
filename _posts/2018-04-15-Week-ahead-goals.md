So last week was unfortunately not as productive as I had planned as a result of some dog-sitting shenanigans. So, to help myself get back on top of things, I'm making a list of what I want to and will accomplish this week. Firstly, tomorrow I have a presentation in my FISH 511 class, so I will be focusing on that today and tomorrow. The rest of the week will be as follows:

Tuesday: 
- Finish Qubit
- Finish FINAL RNA isolation of the sub-group of samples I selected a while back. The remaining samples to be isolated are the samples from the three crabs that survived the warm treatment so I cannot mess up. 

Wednesday: 
- Organize spreadsheets
- Organize OWL (add READMEs)

Thursday: 
- Continue organization from day before
- Edit and publish Crab Mtg #2 (S1 Ep 5)

Friday:
- Organizing spreadsheets/ OWL
- WRITE: [crab project](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xZjT_2ix39jhFGhPjUqjOIubCEZfnl9yDddIjR3nY38/edit)
