See post for details on the second batch of RNA extractions for the new dataset.

# Samples Chosen
Note: Like in the previous batch (Notebook post: [here](https://grace-ac.github.io/MUSP-extractions_01/)), I am randomizing the samples from Day 6 (exposeed + control) and Day 12 (control).

# RNA Extraction
Notes:      

Start labeling at 1:26pm           
Start extraction protocol at 2:20pm; incubate 2:30-3:07pm                 
End at 4:55pm          

- Added 96mL of 100% EToH to a new bottle (From the opened 2024 kit) of DNA/RNA Wash Buffer because I think there isn't enough currently for these 18 samples --> didn't end up using for this batch, but it's ready for tomorrow


# Qubit Results:    
Total samples to run: 18+12 = 30    
I'm going to do them in two batches.     
So each batch will be: 15 samples + 2 standards + 1 extra rxn == 18 preps

I let the two standards come up to room temp (they're stored in fridge).    

Therefore:     
Working solution:     
18 x 1ul RNA HS Dye = **18ul RNA HS Dye**     
18 x 199ul RNA HS Buffer = **3582ul RNA HS Buffer**     

Standards:     
10ul S1 + 190ul working Solution     
10ul S2 + 190ul working Solution     

Samples:    
1ul Sample + 199ul working solution      

Vortex all samples and standards after working solution added for 3-5mins.     
Incubate at room temp for 2 minutes.    

## Results:   
BATCH 1 (423-431)             
S1 --> 68.35         
S2 --> 971.17    

BATCH 2 (433-564)    
S1 --> 71.63   
S2 --> 1120.38

LONG STORY SHORT:

# THERE IS ENOUGH RNA IN ALL SAMPLES SO FAR FOR RNASEQ HUZZAH
