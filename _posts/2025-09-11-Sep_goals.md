See post about my goals for this month!

# Paper Revisions
Due back to journal **Sept 18th** (one week from today). 

1. Get feedback from Steven about the re-done `DESeq2` results and see what makes sense for moving forward on that.
2. Continue my work on the other revisions which are primarily adding more immune system context to the introduction and being more specific in discussion and methods, etc. Good progress on this, but still more to do. 

# New Multi-Species Data!
The new set of data is ready!!

I have downloaded it to the computer in Steven's lab and it is currently transferring to [owl.fish.washington.edu/nightingales/P_helianthoides](https://owl.fish.washington.edu/nightingales/P_helianthoides/). 

Once that transfer is complete later today, I'll run the checksums and then create a separate post describing the data and where it lives. 

# Crab Paper
Find a journal to prepare it for to submit. BioRxiv paper here: [Uncovering Host-Parasite Dynamics: Gene Expression Shifts in Hematodinium-infected Chionoecetes bairdi in Response to Temperature Change](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.06.05.658092v2.abstract)

# Conferences coming up:
1. I got accepted and some funding to attend a conference in New York [Student Conference on Conservation Science-New York](https://www.amnh.org/research/center-for-biodiversity-conservation/convening-and-connecting/sccs-ny). I got accepted to present a lightning talk, which I've never done before and am interested in giving it a shot! I was awarded some funding from FINS to help cover costs. This conference is Oct 15-17, 2025. 

2. I submitted an abstract to [Western Society of Naturalists](https://www.wsn-online.org/) conference that's happening this November (7-9) in San Diego. Waiting to hear if my talk abstract as accepted.
