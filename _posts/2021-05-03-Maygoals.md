### Oyster paper
- make Fig 2 into a pie?
- clean up github repo

### Crab paper
We didn't get it published through Scientific Reports, so I think we're going to submit it to BMC Genomics instead. 

- Submit to BMC Genomics

### Misc
- Finish DNA extractions for Jackie (shouldn't take longer than a day or two) 
- Send the extracted RNA to the sequencing facility for Jackie
- Organize Tanner crab samples in -80
