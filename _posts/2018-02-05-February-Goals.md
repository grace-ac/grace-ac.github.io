I would have made this post on the actual first day of February, but I have been sick - the neverending cold. 
Anyway, for this short month I have some goals I'd like to achieve:

- Test out the microphones that I rented from the Student Technology Loan Project (they are due back on Feb. 7)
- Test out the RNA Isolation protocol on some of the extra Tanner crab hemolymph samples
- Continue working on the 2015 *C. gigas* oysterseed DIA analysis
- Read more papers on Tanner crab, *Hematodinium spp.*, gene expression, etc. I will be testing out how Mendeley will work for me in organizing the papers I read and for note-taking
