Updates on RNA isolation sample picking; DecaPod; and DIA analysis progress.

### RNA Isolation Sample picking

I picked some samples for RNA Isolation. I will begin tomorrow! Here is the link to the spreadsheet with the selected samples: [here](http://owl.fish.washington.edu/scaphapoda/grace/Crab-project/samples-for-RNA-isolation.xlsx)

### Podcast

I created a little podcast intro for DecaPod. I also edited the meeting recording from when Steven and I talked last week. I don't know how to publish them to the bitter crab website, so I'll ask Steven tomorrow. I want to record a background information podcast episode for next week. 

### DIA Analysis

Emma had to reschedule our meeting today for tomrorrow. But she will help me understand how to calculate the error rate more accurately, becasue I don't think I know what I'm doing!
