Here's what Steven and I talked about and what I'll focus on after I send out my RNA.    

Here's the post from yesterday where I laid out the agenda items: [Here](https://grace-ac.github.io/SR-mtg-prep/)  

# TLDR: What I'll Aim To Have by Next Week:    

1. A list of the `head` of all the files I have from collaborators related to each species in the readme of the repository       
2. Count matrices that I trust from each species     
3. `BLAST` outputs from the `augustus.codingseq.aa` or equivalent files from each species        
    i. `join` the `BLAST` ouptut with the count matrices     

**Also: Apply to funding from the College of the Environment for Conference Travel: DUE JULY 11**

# Notes on what we talked about:

For Each Species:      
- Align data to respective genomes     
- Get count matrices     
- Annotate       

BLAST to uniprot → https://github.com/grace-ac/paper-pycno-sswd-2021-2022/wiki/Key-Files

- Join with count matrix → this will functionally annotate it     
- Make sure each count matrix has fasta file that has same gene name that can be joined
