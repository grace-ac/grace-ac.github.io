Today I continue RNA isolation using the newer version of the protocol. Successful day!


### RNA Isolation

Today I isolated another batch of RNA! I totally missed the isopropanol in the flammables cabinet - quite embarrassing. However, it wasn't listed in the MyChem inventory... but I did look at that bottle multiple times and it just didn't register in my brain that it was what I was looking for. Isopropanol can also be called "2-propanol", which was the label on the bottle I had been using thus far.

Anyway, so I was happy to continue with the RNA isolations today.
