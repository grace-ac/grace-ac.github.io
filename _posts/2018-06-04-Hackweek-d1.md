Tips and tricks for Jekyll notebook posts. 

Learned how to upload images NOT using a URL, which means that they will render even if I'm offline. 

Image example:         
`![img](../notebook-images/20180604-hackweek-test-pic.png)`

Learned how to have multiple categories in a post.

Example:         
`categories: [MonthlyGoals, bairdi]`
