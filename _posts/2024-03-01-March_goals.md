Goals for this month!

## Pub-a-thon
[Pubathon](https://robertslab.github.io/resources/Pubathon/) has officially started! I need this extra accountability and the possibility of getting points every week!  I'll be putting effort into my Summer 2021 paper for now - My goals for next week's pub-a-thon meeting is to have my methods complete for that paper and ready to receive feedback.

## Summer 2023 extractions
Get these done this month!! And send them out for sequencing asap. The extracted RNA will be from samples from the multi-species experiment. We had some new budgeting asks, so I may be able to get more sequenced than originally planned, but I'll move forward with our first tier of samples of interest.

## Eelgrass work
I'm heading up to Friday Harbor Labs this Sunday (March 3) and will be up there until March 17th. While I'm up there, I'll primarily be working on the eelgrass team projects related to investigating how the eelgrass microbiome plays a role in the system of wasting disease, and also some field work experiments. I'm very excited to be headed back up there and to get to work with the fun and cool team again!
