# First Paper Submission
Due to the journal this Friday, and I essentially just have to wrap it all up and submit! 

# MultiSpecies New Data Set
I have completed some data processing on the new data (See [post](https://grace-ac.github.io/MUSP-d6d12-data-processing/)). 

My current phase is to align each species' data to their respective genomes, modelling off of the code I've done previously. 

I'm aiming to have new results --> `DESeq2` comparisons between exposed and controls within each species; enrichment; and comparison across species - by WSN (Nov 7-9, 2025). 

So step-by-step goals are:     
- Align each species' RNAseq data to their genomes      
- `DESeq2` comparisons     
- Enrichment
