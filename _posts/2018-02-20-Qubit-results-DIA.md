Today I tested out Qubit for the first time as well as moving on to step 4 in the DIA protocol.


## Qubit

I followed the protocol for Qubit to see if the two samples I processed on Friday contain any RNA.

Unfortunately, I didn't pay attention to which sample was first, so I don't know which one was out of range. But, one of them was out of range, and one of them had a concentration of 4.04 ng/µL.

I used 5µL of sample. So what does this mean?
2 things:
1. I should use more µL of sample (I can use between 1 and 20µL. Sam recommended I start between 1 and 5 µL)
2. There wasn't any RNA in the sample that was "out of range".

I think the only way to tell whether there was RNA or not would be to do it again, but with more µL of sample.

## DIA Analysis

The .blib file from the original attempt at analyzing the 2015 Oysterseed data used all the files, so I am ready to get into Skyline again! I will continue tomorrow starting from [Step 4](https://github.com/RobertsLab/resources/blob/master/protocols/DIA-data-Analyses.md#step-4-add-files-to-skyline).

This evening, I'm working on my proposal for FISH 521, due this week.
