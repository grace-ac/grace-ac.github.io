#### [NPRB GSRA Application](https://www.nprb.org/assets/uploads/files/GSRA/2019_GSRA.pdf)
I almost applied for this last year, but it was during my first official month as a graduate student and it felt like too much all at once. 

But, I have a whole bunch of ideas written down that Pam has shared with me, and I want to apply! It is due by February 8th, so I want to get the majority of it taken care of this month. I will be speaking with Pam and Steven as I go through the application process and fine-tune what ideas will work best to propose.
