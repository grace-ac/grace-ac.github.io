title: Two Week Goals - Lab Meeting 
date: '2025-10-19'
categories: [MultiSpecies, TWG]

Update on the goals I made two weeks ago at the last Lab Meeting.  

# Goals Made 2025-10-06 
1. Finish alignment for all three species 
2. Have DEG lists from basic control vs exposed within each species 

# Status --> ACHIEVED! 
1. See post: [Multi-Species - Matrices for each species](https://grace-ac.github.io/musp-matrices/)
2. See post: [Multi-Species - Control V Exposed within each species DESeq2](https://grace-ac.github.io/musp-deseq2-cve-3species/)  

# Goals that I'll aim to set during tomorrow's meeting for the subsequent lab meeting *Nov 3rd*:   
1. Annotate DEG lists (control vs exposed within each species)          
2. Think of some other visualizations/analyses to do         
3. Slides for WSN - put a practice talk date on the calendar          
4. PhD proposal draft done and sent to committee (Committee Mtg Nov 13th)        
5. Progress on *hopefully* final revisions for Phil Trans B paper (it got sent back last week - final due date **Nov 10th**)

# Questions for the group: 
1. How can I approach investigating the potential batch effect of my RNAseq Data? 
For context, the multispecies libraries from Day 12 exposed were extracted and sequenced separately from the control Day 12 and the control and exposed Day 6 and 12. 

2. What other analyses should I try to do for multispecies by WSN?
