Images from my trying out the bioanalyzer. And I try again. Neither tries look great. I should try again. Pub-a-thon plan and DecaPod S1E7 published (crab mtg #3).

## Bioanalyzer

Last week I tried the bioanalyzer a couple times on tubes numbered 274 and 401.   
Things didn't look so great.

[GitHub issue](https://github.com/RobertsLab/resources/issues/246)

Sam suggested I just try again and also use tubes with very high RNA concentration.   

So today I tried with tubes 14 (123.0 ng/mL) and 348 (144.0 ng/mL) (FRP 6144; infected; ambient). 

Looks weird again.

Looking at it now, I think I maybe messed it up by selecting "mRNA pico" instead of "Eukaryote_total-RNA". Will ask Sam to see what's up.   

Will re-do tomorrow. 

## Pub-a-thon
Points - get points by commenting and reviewing others' papers and repos!

DIA paper - get Emma over for the next Pubathon meeting (once date and time determined) to talk about next steps and moving forward with the paper.   

Crab paper - methods and introduction stuff of whatever I can add
