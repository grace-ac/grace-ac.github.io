## Trinity
My [Trinity job failed](https://github.com/RobertsLab/resources/issues/465) and it turns out it's because I was missing a ```\``` after ```/gscratch/srlab/programs/Trinity-v2.8.3/Trinity ```. I fixed that and then re-sent the job to Mox. The new script is called 20181101_Cbairdi_trinity.sh and it lives in my ```/gscratch/srlab/graceac9/jobs/``` directory on Mox.

Here's the [FastQC results](http://gannet.fish.washington.edu/Atumefaciens/20181015_Cbairdi_fastqc/multiqc_report.html) that Sam did on the RNAseq data when it came in. Looks good!
