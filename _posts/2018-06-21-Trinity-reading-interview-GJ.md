Today I did more reading on how to start assembling a transcriptome using Trinity with plans to formulate the beginning steps tomorrow and I interviewed Genevieve Johnson (University of Alaska, Fairbanks) on her thesis project doing Tanner Crab population genetics for a new soon-to-be published episode of DecaPod.

### Trinity
I read a lot of cool things about Trinity and here are some links to useful information:    
Main Trinity wiki: https://github.com/trinityrnaseq/trinityrnaseq/wiki

Trinity _de novo_ Transcriptome assembly workshop:  https://github.com/trinityrnaseq/RNASeq_Trinity_Tuxedo_Workshop/wiki/Trinity-De-novo-Transcriptome-Assembly-Workshop


### DecaPod S1E9
Genevieve Johnson stopped by today (she's in Seattle for a conference) and I recorded her sharing her experience performing her thesis work on population genetics of Tanner Crabs of Alaska. It was a really good interview and she is very good at communicating, so I won't have to spend too much time editing and publishing! Will be published either tonight or tomorrow! Woo!
