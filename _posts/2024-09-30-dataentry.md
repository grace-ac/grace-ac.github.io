Today, I got all the "to-do" data entry datasheets organized and scanned for summer 2022 experiments and entered 5 stars-worth of data. See post for a few more details.

# Summer 2022
We had 100 stars, and did 4 experiments, plus at least 3 different mini-trials, and I have a HUGE binder of star observational data.

I entered most of it in 2022/2023, and had the intention to finish it up this summer in my "down-time"... but that down-time never really happened.

So, I went through all 100 stars datasheets today and a little last week to inventory what has been entered, and I QC'ed what was entered. I scanned the remaining datasheets  that need to be entered, and I entered 5 stars-worth of data today.

There remains 16 stars, and I'll be splitting that between myself, Melanie, and Alyssa so that we can wrap this up this week.

The data we collected are our daily observations of each star throughout each experiments. Each star was observed twice daily, and things like position in the tank, any disease signs, and whether they were fed or not, and whether they were sampled or not was recorded.

I'm excited that we'll finally have this completed likely by the end of the week as it has been an ongoing to-do list item... and I'm grateful to have some help from Melanie and Alyssa!

Stay tuned for tomorrow's October Goals post!
