I isolate RNA from another batch of 9 samples (3 crabs) and I try to understand what I'm doing in terms of determining peak-picking error rate.


### RNA Isolation

I isolated RNA from 9 more samples:

### Note that sample 305 is actually labeled as "#4". 

During the isolation, tubes 66 and 26 (infected, first day samples) I wasn't able to see any obvious pellets like I have been able to in all other tubes.

### DIA

I am in the process of checking the error rate. A lot of them look good. 

Below is an example of one that I'm not 100% sure about, but I am giving it a "0" score because the peak boundaries are off and becuase the peaks are slightly different. So, currently, I am only giving "1" scores to perfect peptides across all samples. Not sure if this is reasonable.
