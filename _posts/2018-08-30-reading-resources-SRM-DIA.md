I've been sick the past several days, and I'm finally feeling well enough to come in to SAFS. Today, since I'm still not back to normal, I spent the day reading some background information on SRM, Targeted proteomics, and general crab biology. I also outline some goals I have from now until the start of school on September 25th. 

## SRM, DIA, Skyline reading resources
- [Mass Spectrometry in a nutshell](https://bitesizebio.com/6016/how-does-mass-spec-work/)
- [Targeted Proteomics by SRM](http://proteomicsresource.washington.edu/protocols06/MRM.php)

## General Crab Info
Pam lended me a book called "The Biology of Crabs" by G.F. Warner. It's a great resource for biological and taxonomic background information on all things crustacean.  

## Goals for before school starts September 25th
- Figure out this Skyline DIA thing once and for all! Emma has been busy, but hopefully next week she'll be able to look at it
- Analyze the 2015 Oysterseed data
- As soon as the lyophilizer is fixed (hopefully soon!!), test out RNA extraction using Tri-Reagent
- Continue to learn more background info on _C. bairdi_, _Hematodinium_, Bitter Crab disease, and the 2015 Oysterseed project
