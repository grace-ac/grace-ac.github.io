Picking some preliminary samples for RNA isolation and getting questions answered about the RNA isolation protocol. 


Today I re-picked the samples that I'll use for RNA extraction. I realized that I could easily choose samples from the same crabs across all sampling days and temperatures. I went back and amended the [initial post](https://github.com/grace-ac/grace-ac.github.io/blob/master/_posts/2018-01-25-Crab-sample-picking.md) with the new choices, so that I don't get confused in the future.

I also went through the [RNA isolation protocol](https://github.com/RobertsLab/resources/blob/master/protocols/rna_isolation_rnazol_rt.md) a little more in-depth and came up with some questions, which were answered in GitHub issues [#167](https://github.com/RobertsLab/resources/issues/167) and [#172](https://github.com/RobertsLab/resources/issues/172).
