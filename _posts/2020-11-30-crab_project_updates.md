This post details what's been going on with the crab paper. The paper is almost done!!! 

### Paper: 
The paper is almost in a final draft mode - I just need to do some minor edits and fix the tense. I switch from past to present all over the place! Hoping to submit it somewhere before the end of the year. 

### Crab Samples:
My goal by the end of the year is to go into lab and organize all the -80 samples. There are so many boxes of hemolymph and the associated RNAlater supernatant from when the samples were taken... and they aren't well organized. I know well enough how to find my way through the samples, but it's just a little too chaotic, so I want to go in and create maps for each box so whoever wants to use them can easily find the box, and find their specific sample within the box. 

### Crab repos:
I have a repo that's specific for the crab paper: [RobertsLab/paper-tanner-crab](https://github.com/RobertsLab/paper-tanner-crab). I will be getting this more organized and cleaned up in the next few weeks, so that it can serve as a supplementary to the paper.      

I also have a repo for the crab project as a whole: [RobertsLab/project-crab](https://github.com/RobertsLab/project-crab). This repo will serve as a resource for the lab and others who want to be able to find the background on the project, and all associated data and materials. I've been slowly working on cleaning this repo out and getting all necessary and useful things in there clearly labeled and explained in the readme files. 

## Overall "To-Do's" for crab-related things:      
1. Finish paper by end of the year, and have [RobertsLab/paper-tanner-crab](https://github.com/RobertsLab/paper-tanner-crab) repo cleaned up and organized.     
2. Clean up and organize the [RobertsLab/project-crab](https://github.com/RobertsLab/project-crab) repo so that it will serve as a useful and clear resource for the lab and others      
3. Organize crab samples in the -80 freezer
4. Make sure that there's a clear step-by-step guide somewhere on how to create and publish a podcast, and put the guide somewhere that will be useful for the lab.
