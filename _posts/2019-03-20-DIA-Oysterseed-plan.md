Today we had our first WSG meeting with the goal of having all of the projects wrapped up by April 17th. 

We will be meeting every Wednesday at 2pm. 

### Things to focus on for this week:
- METHODS SECTION
- Creating easy visuals comparing 23C and 29C

To create Venn Diagram for 23C v 29C:    
1. BLAST proteome used in DIA with uniprot/swissprot database (make a new database with the newest uniprot/swissprot fasta? ([#618](https://github.com/RobertsLab/resources/issues/618)))
2. Join blast output with GO and GOslim terms
3. Join GO and GOslim with skyline output file
4. Compare terms between 23C and 29C 

Steven will take a look at [Oyster-Larval-Proteomics](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OaYNzlOJr5QibCYt8--GMNGvXlzHPR9_daCkNUVkj-U/edit#) paper and capture all the important and interesting stuff.

Methods:
Proteomics      

Results:     
Abundance counts     
What proteins are expressed in total      
Comparison of proteins expressed between two temps     

My notes from meeting:    
```
Due by April 17

Point is to bring up what challenges are and get them solved asap â€”> GITHUB ISSUES

FOCUS ON METHODS JUST ASSOCIATED WITH PROTEOMICS

FOCUS ON GETTING RESULTS

What journal should this go to?

probably first time DIA shotgun proteomics done with gigas oysterseed 

next week: have methods done, maybe best three interesting things from results
