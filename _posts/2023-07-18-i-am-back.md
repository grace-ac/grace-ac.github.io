Hello! I'm back! I have been working for Drew Harvell as a technician on two projects: Sea Star Wasting Disease and Eelgrass Wasting Disease. I am turning the three-years-worth of work I did on the sea star project into an upcoming PhD, and will also be doing one chapter on eelgrass wasting disease. VERY EXCITED AND EXCITING.

I'll be officially starting this upcoming Fall Quarter at UW SAFS, and am very excited to be returning to Steven Roberts' Lab!

I'll write up some summary posts in the coming weeks about what we've been up to, and will primarily be adding new updates about an upcoming experiment that will comprise a portion of the PhD: a multi-species experiment where I'll be looking at the differences in immune response across three different species when they are exposed to wasting using transcriptomics.

Stay tuned!
