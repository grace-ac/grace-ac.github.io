Today I chose some crab samples for RNA extraction. [I made a chart](http://owl.fish.washington.edu/scaphapoda/grace/Crab-project/Samples-for-RNA-isolation.png) with the tube numbers for the samples. All crabs are immature males. Due to a massive die-off in the warm temperature treatment groups, we unfortunately only have two infected and one uninfected sample per the final two sample days. As a result, the uninfected samples will not be "pooled". 

There will be 14 pooled samples, and they are represented by the groupings in blue.
