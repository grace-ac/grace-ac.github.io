Today I edited and published DecaPod S1E11: Crab Meeting #5. I also have a plan for the format of the podcast.

[S1 E11: Crab Meeting #5](https://bittercrab.wordpress.com/2018/09/07/decapod-s1e11-crab-meeting-5/)

After talking with Yaamini about my thoughts on how I should plan out the seasons for DecaPod, she mentioned that it could be based on the phase of the project, which makes perfect sense to me.

The seasons may vary by episode numbers, but I'll separate the seasons by project phase.

Season 1: planning and troubleshooting RNA isolation, libraries
Season 2: data analysis
Season 3: results/ findings/ etc. 

And I think I'm going to keep doing intermittent interviews on crab subjects with new people I meet along the way who are willing to do so.
