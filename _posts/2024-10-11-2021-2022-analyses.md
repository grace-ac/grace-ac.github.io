Analyses updates for 2021/2022 data. And update on multi-species RNAseq data availability. Working more tomorrow on getting 2021/2022 DEG lists - check out my next post for that. 

# Multi-Species Data
Ok quick update on this -- I tried to log in to the server that will have the raw data and it didn't work. I emailed the folks that I've been working with to get more information, but I'm fairly certain it didn't work because the data still isn't available yet, which is a note on my portal for the project on Genewiz.

So.... I must continue to wait. Which is fine - I have plenty of other stuff to work on. I'm just very excited about the multi-species dataset because I think it's going to be the coolest yet!
