Just about a week late... here's a post about my goals for the month! Yay.

# Summer 2021 Pycno project
Re-run differential gene expression workflow and annotate. Once I have clear results, then move into the paper more.        
Have a draft paper complete by the end of this month or at least this quarter (March 16th)    

# Summer 2023 Multispecies Sea Star Wasting Disease Samples
Extract RNA from the libraries that we have chosen to answer our questions of interest. Send off for sequencing before I leave for Friday Harbor (March 3rd) or if not, have samples ready to be sent when I return March 18th!

# Other
Update my website.   
Start and complete my class project for Ocean 530.    
Compile reading material for sea star projects and come up with a good system for note-taking and organization of papers and resources that works best for me!
