# Current work

# Background

Hello, welcome to my website! My name is Grace Crandall and I am a current PhD student in the [Steven Roberts Lab](https://faculty.washington.edu/sr320/) at the School of Aquatic and Fishery Sciences, University of Washington. I am advised by Steven Roberts and Drew Harvell.

My work focuses primarily on using transcriptomics to understand the immune response of _Pycnopodia helianthoides_ to exposure to sea star wasting disease. Check out my lab notebook and my github (linked below) for more information.   

I'm also part of a group studying eelgrass wasting disease in the San Juan Islands.
