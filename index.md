Hello! Welcome to my new website! My name is Grace Crandall, and I am a recent graduate from the School of Aquatic and Fishery Sciences at the University of Washington and received an MSc in June 2020. I also received a certificate in One Health from the Center for One Health Research at the University of Washington in the School of Public Health. 

This website is under construction, but you can check out my lab notebook posts at the Lab Notebook tab in the navigation bar in the meantime.
