Hello! Welcome to my new website! My name is Grace Crandall, and I am a recent graduate from the School of Aquatic and Fishery Sciences at the University of Washington and received an MSc in June 2020. 

This website is under construction, but you can check out my lab notebook posts at the Lab Notebook tab in the navigation bar in the meantime.
